  """Given sequences and scores, will gather the top k=beam size sequences.

  This function is used to grow alive, and finished. It takes sequences,
  scores, and flags, and returns the top k from sequences, scores_to_gather,
  and flags based on the values in scores.

  This method permits easy introspection using tfdbg.  It adds two named ops
  that are prefixed by `prefix`:
    - _topk_seq: the tensor for topk_seq returned by this method.
    - _topk_flags: the tensor for topk_finished_flags returned by this method.

  Args:
    sequences: Tensor of sequences that we need to gather from.
      [batch_size, beam_size, seq_length]
    scores: Tensor of scores for each sequence in sequences.
      [batch_size, beam_size]. We will use these to compute the topk.
    scores_to_gather: Tensor of scores for each sequence in sequences.
      [batch_size, beam_size]. We will return the gathered scores from here.
      Scores to gather is different from scores because for grow_alive, we will
      need to return log_probs, while for grow_finished, we will need to return
      the length penalized scores.

  """Beam search with length penalties.

  Requires a function that can take the currently decoded symbols and return
  the logits for the next symbol. The implementation is inspired by
  https://arxiv.org/abs/1609.08144.

  When running, the beam search steps can be visualized by using tfdbg to watch
  the operations generating the output ids for each beam step.  These operations
  have the pattern:
    (alive|finished)_topk_(seq,scores)

  Operations marked `alive` represent the new beam sequences that will be
  processed in the next step.  Operations marked `finished` represent the
  completed beam sequences, which may be padded with 0s if no beams finished.

  Operations marked `seq` store the full beam sequence for the time step.
  Operations marked `scores` store the sequence's final log scores.

  The beam search steps will be processed sequentially in order, so when
  capturing observed from these operations, tensors, clients can make
  assumptions about which step is being recorded.

  num_prefilter is a theoretically lossy shortcut around slow performance of
  top_k on TPU on large Tensors and large k.  This option should be removed once
  better top_k implementations on TPU are available.  If num_prefilter is set to
  a nonzero value, then at each step we first compute the top num_prefilter
  sequences per beam and then compute the top k sequences overall from among
  those.  Empirically, there seems to be no quality difference in setting
  num_prefilter to 2.
